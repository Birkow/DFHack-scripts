    :tags: fort auto plants

This is the configuration interface for the `autochop` plugin. You can configure
which burrows will be used for tree chopping, your target stock quantities, and
other options. You can also see how many logs you have, the number of logs that
the trees on the map are estimated to yield, and how many of each are currently
inaccessible.
