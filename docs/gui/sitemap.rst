gui/sitemap
===========

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: List and zoom to locations at the current site.
    :tags: adventure fort inspection

This simple UI shows a searchable list of all locations -- temples, guildhalls,
hospitals, taverns, and libraries -- at the current site. Clicking on a list
item will zoom the map to that location. If the location has multiple zones
attached to it, clicking again will zoom to each component zone in turn.

This also works in adventure mode, though of course you have to be visiting a
site for the list to show any locations.
