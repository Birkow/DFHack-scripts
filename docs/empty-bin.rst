    :summary: Empty the contents of containers onto the floor.
    :tags: fort productivity items

This tool can quickly empty the contents of the selected container (bin,
barrel, pot, wineskin, quiver, etc.) onto the floor, allowing you to access
individual items that might otherwise be hard to get to.

Note that if there are liquides in the container, they will empty onto the floor
and become unusable.

You may also select a stockpile to empty all containers within it, or you can run this
script when your mouse is over a tile - that will empty all containers present on that tile.
