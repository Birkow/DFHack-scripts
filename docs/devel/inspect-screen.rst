devel/inspect-screen
====================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Show glyph, color, and texture info for screen and map tiles.
    :tags: dev

This script pops up a panel that shows all known information about the tile
under the mouse cursor. This includes the displayed character or text for the
selected tile and foreground/background color information. All textures
associated with the tile and flags associated with those textures are also
displayed.

You can toggle between seeing information for the UI grid tiles or the map
tiles. Click on a tile to freeze the displayed information so you can scroll
the information about the tile or move/resize the inspector window without
changing the active tile.
