    :summary: Set the graphics FPS cap.
    :tags: dfhack fps

This command can set the FPS cap at runtime. This is useful for when you want to
speed up the game or watch combat in slow motion.

Note that setting the cap higher than what your computer can support will not
make the game go any faster.
