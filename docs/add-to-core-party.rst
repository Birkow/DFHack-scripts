.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Promotes one of your companions to become a controllable adventurer.
    :tags: adventure gameplay units

When you run this script, it will show you a list of your extra party and let you choose
who to promote into your "core party", aka let you control them in the tactics mode, not
dissimilar to what you get if you create a group of adventurers during character creation.
