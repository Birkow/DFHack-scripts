==================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Fix tile occupancy flags.
    :tags: unavailable

This tool clears bad occupancy flags at the selected tile. It is useful for
getting rid of phantom "building present" messages when trying to build
something in an obviously empty tile.

To use, select a tile with the in-game "look" (:kbd:`k` mode) cursor.
